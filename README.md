# Report on the Neural Network Model

  With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:


## Overview of the analysis
   In this analysis we perform the Machine Learning and nural networks, we ll use **Charity_data.csv** file as our dataset and use this dataset's features for creating the **Binary Classifier** and make sure it that it is capable of predicting whether applicant be successful if funded by **Alphabet Soup**.
   **Charity_data.csv**file contains the following columns with about more then 34,000 of received funding data.
   
   - EIN and NAME—Identification columns
   - APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
   - AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
   - CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
   - USE_CASE—Use case for funding
   - ORGANIZATION—Organization type
   - STATUS—Active status
   - INCOME_AMT—Income classification
   - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
   - ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
   - IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
   

## Results:
    We works for 3 Deliverable here , 
    Deliverable 1: In this deliverable we Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model.
    Deliverable 2: We Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model data which we got in the Deliverable 1.
    Deliverable 3: In this deliverable we optimize the model.
 * ### Data Preprocessing
 * ### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
